My Hello World (intro to GetHub)

Hello there, My name is David. I'm been looking into programming for a few years now after a friend gave me an ASP.NET book. I've been working through tutorials on Microsoft Virtual Academy, Udacity, and currently Pluralsite. Early on I was running through Bob Tabor's site. 

Unfortunately, I still feel like I need more in order to make something of my own. I feel like I've been learning a lot about car transmitions, engines, and various other car parts... but still not how to assemble them into a car. 

Regardless. Here is my GitHub account. Here is the first file, as the tutorial explains to me how to use GitHub. Hopefully I can look back at this info in a few months (years, whatever) and laugh.
